# Scroll Animation - 100Projects100Days

This project is the 24th sub-project of the 100Projects100Days series.

## Description

The "Scroll Animation" project is the 24th project in the 100Projects100Days series. Each day, a new project is developed to enhance programming skills. In this project, a scroll animation effect is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the user scrolls down the page, the content on the webpage animates to create dynamic visual effects.

## Features

- Content on the webpage animates as the user scrolls.
- Various elements such as images, text, and backgrounds can be animated using CSS transitions or animations.
- Smooth and visually appealing animations enhance the user experience.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Scroll down the webpage to see the scroll animation effects on different elements.
3. Observe how the animations trigger and enhance the overall presentation of the content.
